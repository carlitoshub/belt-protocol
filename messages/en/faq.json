      "question": "What are the tangible, economic, or productive benefits that adopting the BELT methodology can bring to companies?",
      "answer": "Companies that adopt BELT typically see a reduction in incident rates, lower insurance costs, improved employee morale, and increased productivity. The behavior-based approach creates measurable, trackable improvements across all safety KPIs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is there a measurable correlation between the safety culture introduced by BELT and improved company performance?",
      "answer": "Yes. Organizations with strong safety cultures consistently outperform their peers — fewer lost workdays, lower turnover, and higher engagement scores. BELT provides the framework to build and measure that culture systematically."
    },
    {
      "question": "What should be done if some managers perceive BELT as an additional complication or a waste of time? How can this resistance be managed?",
      "answer": "Resistance is normal and expected. BELT addresses this through leadership workshops that reframe safety as a strategic advantage, not a burden. Early wins — tracked and shared visibly — help bring skeptics on board quickly."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the most common mistake companies make when trying to change their safety culture?",
      "answer": "The most common mistake is focusing on rules and compliance rather than behaviors and mindsets. Telling people what not to do doesn't build culture. BELT focuses on reinforcing what people do right, which creates lasting change."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does it take to see tangible results when applying BELT, and what is the first thing that changes in a company after adopting this method?",
      "answer": "Most organizations begin to see measurable behavioral shifts within the first 60–90 days. The first visible change is almost always communication — teams start talking about safety differently, and reporting near-misses increases because trust has grown."
